# Linux-Atomic-Wazuh-Simulation-Lab
Complete End-to-End Lab: Simulating Linux MITRE ATT&amp;CK with Atomic Red Team, Velociraptor &amp; Wazuh

## Project Objective
This open-source security lab demonstrates how to simulate MITRE ATT&CK techniques on Linux and detect them using real-world blue team tooling. The goal is to help learners understand attacker behavior and validate detection using modern EDR and DFIR frameworks.
You will:
  - Simulate attacks with Atomic Red Team (e.g., T1059.004)
  - Detect adversarial activity with Wazuh SIEM/EDR
  - Hunt and collect artifacts using Velociraptor
  - Learn the theory, architecture, and configuration details
